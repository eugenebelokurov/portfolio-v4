# Design that builds trust between doctors and AI

I helped early-stage medtech startup to redesign one of their core products. The company built proof of concept using no-code tool and was ready for the next step. I joined the team to identify usability issues and make the product look smart and trustworthy. With insights from doctors and the team, I rebuilt the product from the ground up: new information architecture, explanations of AI recommendations and new visual language. As a result, I delivered an interactive prototype using Next.js.

- my role: run user research, designed wireframes, coded interactive prototypes
- team: me, 4 doctors, 1 ML engineer, 1 product owner
- year: 2025
- timeline: 4 weeks

## Product
Imagine a private hospital or clinic. Every doctor appointment results in patient notes. These notes have to comply with both government regulations and internal rules. If a doctor fails to provide a correct diagnosis, it may result in incorrect treatment, fines from an insurance company, lost profit and even criminal charges.

To prevent that, clinics implement quality assurance practices. Usually, about 10% of all notes are assessed, manually. This results in missed errors and a cumbersome process of tracking the doctors’ performance.

This is where the product comes in. It analyses 100% of all protocols across 300 parameters, ranging from ones impacting treatment to formatting issues.

## Problem
- **Information architecture issues.** Key information missing or hidden, 
- **Non-actionable AI recommendations.** With AI labels like “good quality” or “critical quality”, doctors didn’t know how to prioritise notes to be looked at.
- **“No code builder” style and accessibility issues.** The visual style became a problem on sales calls. On top of that, doctors complained about small font sizes and being overwhelmed by the interface.

## Solution
Dashboard before and after
<ImageContainerMdx projectId={5} imageId="old-dashboard" captionShow={true} />
<ImageContainerMdx projectId={5} imageId="dashboard-id" captionShow={true} />


Patient notes before and after
<ImageContainerMdx projectId={5} imageId="patient-notes-before-id" captionShow={true} />
<ImageContainerMdx projectId={5} imageId="patient-notes-id" captions="After" captionShow={true} />

## Metrics
We settled on tracking the “trustworthiness” and a number of new deals closed.

## Why this solution

I have run interviews and closed card sorting research with doctors to gather insights and decide on information architecture.

</div>

The most used filters are always displayed. Doctors get feedback about the number of records.

Structure of the protofol page: header with key info, original notes from the assesment, AI feedback

The header was redesigned based on a card sorting exercise: doctors had to prioritise what information should be available immediately, could be one+ click away or unnecessary.
