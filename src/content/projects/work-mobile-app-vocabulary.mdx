# How I designed mobile app from scratch

The app solves the problem of expanding vocabulary for advanced English speakers. I had a chance to get my hands on working with APIs, native mobile products and interface guidelines.

## Problem: it is hard to expand vocabulary for advanced english-speakers

Imagine being new to the english-speaking environment. You would want to express your thoughts with ease hence you are in need of extensive vocabulary. To store and practice regularly you need a tool. My market research showed that there is no one-stop solution.

## Solution: mobile app to collect and practice your vocabulary

Imagine being new to the english-speaking environment. You would want to express your thoughts with ease hence you are in need of extensive vocabulary. To store and practice regularly you need a tool. My market research showed that there is no one-stop solution.

The apps revolves around three main Job Stories: [1] saving new words; [2] learning using spaced repetition methods and flash cards; [3] navigating your dictionary.

## Metrics I would track

Since the app isn't live yet I can only theorise here.

In addition to the below, I would watch Hotjar sessions and track the total number of words saved and practised per user per day to understand if people actually use the product.

- **Daily Active Users (DAU) + WAU + MAU** to understand if the number of active users is growing or falling
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** to understand if [1] the app earns the money and [2] whether money comes from new or retained users
- **Funnel conversion rates** to identify areas for improvement

## Lessons learned

- **Interactive prototypes are hard.** Gained a deep dive into prototyping entire workflows and utilising interactive components in Figma. Also got a chance to learn other tools e.g. Protopie.
- **MD and HIG are a good starting point.** I relied on both Material Design by Google and Human Interface Guidelines by Apple in choosing the layout grid, margins, paddings, touch areas etc. By doing so, I was able to ensure that my designs were in line with industry standards.
- **Design systems speed up development.** I studied design systems made by Uber, Atlassian and OpenAI. They guided me in creating individual elements and components for my app.
- **Colour palette, typography, grid systems.** I relied on "Grid Systems in Graphic Design" by Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann, "The New Typography" by Ian Tschichold and YouTube videos by some brilliant people. These topics are of an infinite depth. But at least I started.
